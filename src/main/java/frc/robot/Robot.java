 * 	Download FRC Update Suite
 * 	Firmware, imaging, etc done in RIO configurer- http://roborio-1661-frc.local (when connected to robot)
 * 		This is usually done in internet explorer, as it is a stable browser.
 * 	Re-image roboRIO- imaging software will come with the update suite
 * 	Check for firmware updates- these will also come with the suite
 * 	Replace the CTRE software if needed- this must be on your computer even if you don't actively use it!!!!!!
 * 		Simply google CTRE and see if there is a new piece of software
 * 	Check for CANTalon firmware updates (C:\Users\Public\Public Documents\FRC\TalonSrx-Application-NEWEST_VERSION)
 * 		The version will be listed on the configurer- compare it to the latest build!
 * 	Make sure the code isn't broken- wpilib changes things every year!
